Here are some changes introduced by recent versions of edbrowse.

3.2.1:
This version introduces sql database access,
through Informix esql (tested) and odbc (not tested).
Access a table in the database just as you would access a file.
Inserts, updates, and deletes are applied to the database,
as they take place in your local buffer.
It's almost wysiwyg.
And it's dangerous.
If you delete a row, there is no undo, so be careful.

3.1.3:
Edbrowse can now fetch and execute a local javascript file,
as in  <script src=LocalFileName.js>
from within a local html file that you are browsing.
This is primarily used by people who build and debug websites, like me.
It is also handy if you have downloaded your own private copy
of a website, and it uses javascript.

3.1.2:
Files (other than text or html) are processed according
to their mime type, which is fancy internet jargon for their file extension.
It's not rocket science - file.mp3 is sent to an mp3 player,
file.wav is sent to a wave player, and so on.
See the docs for more details.

3.1.1:
Version 2 used my own, home-grown javascript engine.
This version, version 3 and beyond, uses an open source js engine,
known as Spider Monkey Javascript, or smjs.
Needless to say, theirs is better than mine.
It's something I should not try to reinvent.
As you might imagine,
many websites will run properly on version 3, but not on version 2.
This is a substantial change to the program,
hence the jump in major version number.

2.2.10:
This is the latest version with my home-grown javascript engine.
If you don't have access to smjs, or you just want to get it up and running
quickly, to see if you like it, you can use 2.2.10.

1.5.17:
This is the latest perl version.
It has no javascript support, nor does it handle edbrowse scripts,
but it is completely portable, and runs on Windows, Mac, etc.
This is the easiest way to take edbrowse out for a spin, to see if you like it.
