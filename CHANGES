Here are some changes introduced by recent versions of edbrowse.

3.5.3:
Write a separate process, edbrowse-js, to handle all the javascript objects.
This process and only this process interacts with the js library,
be it mozilla or v8 or whatever.
Edbrowse implements the document object model at a higher level,
and communicates with edbrowse-js for the corresponding javascript objects.

3.5.2:
The blacklist feature is now gone.
It wasn't really used,
as there are more effective ways to fight spam these days.
Also, there was the possibility that reading an empty blacklist file could
lead to a crash.

This release contains a few additional minor bugfixes, the most significant
of which involved the rendering preformatted sections when browsing html.

3.5.1:
Mozilla javascript version 2.4 and above supports only a C++ interface,
so if we want to keep using moz js, then we must follow along.
Edbrowse 3.5.1 converts the javascript layer from C to C++.
These are the files jsdom.cpp, jsloc.cpp, and html.cpp (use to be .c).
Other files may convert to C++ in the future.
Use the curl library to send and receive mail.
This replaces home-grown pop3 and smtp software.

3.4.10:
Polish translations, courtesy of Wojciech Gac.

3.4.9:
Various bug fixes.

3.4.8:
* Edbrowse now requires version 1.8.5 (or higher) of Spidermonkey.
* When completing filenames with readline, a trailing space is no longer added.
* Updated French translation of the User's Guide, thanks to Erwin Bliesenick.
* Edbrowse now supports localized HTTP responses; see the User's Guide.
* In the Edbrowse scripting language, function names are now
  case-insensitive.

3.4.7:
memcpy and strcpy are no longer called on overlapping regions.
Files with unknown length, such as those under /proc, are now readable.
Miscellaneous fixes.

3.4.6:
Fix file corruption bug for large files with more than a million lines.

3.4.5:
Dot stuffing in emails.
Support for readline() on input.
Support for proxies through .ebrc or the environment.

3.4.4:
Fixed a cookie bug; tail matching never took place.
Thus a cookie would never propagate to a subdomain.  Bad news.

3.4.3:
Hotmail smtp protocol.    outport = ^587
Minor tweaks for compilation under OS X.

3.4.1:
Access to databases through odbc.
Modify rows in a table by using the edit commands you already know.
Be careful; delete means delete!

3.3.4:
Convert between iso8859-1 and utf8 on the fly, according to the contents
of the file and the value of $LANG.
This takes place automatically as files are read and written;
the user shouldn't notice a thing.

3.3.3:
New reply feature, maintains the thread for discussion lists.
Move docs to a doc directory, and source to an src directory.
Fix some utf8 bugs.

3.3.2:
Supports reading of pdf files by calling the utility pdftohtml.
http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/suse/updates/10.0/i386/rpm/i586/pdftohtml-0.36-130.9.i586.html
Also brings in email over ssl.
Secure smtp implies auth login;
no other authentication method is implemented at this time.

3.3.1:
The error and output messages of edbrowse have been internationalized.
Set LANG= to specify the language.
At present, LANG=en and LANG=fr are supported.  (English and French)

3.2.1:
This version introduces sql database access,
through Informix esql (tested) and odbc (not tested).
Access a table in the database just as you would access a file.
Inserts, updates, and deletes are applied to the database,
as they take place in your local buffer.
It's almost wysiwyg.
And it's dangerous.
If you delete a row, there is no undo, so be careful.

3.1.3:
Edbrowse can now fetch and execute a local javascript file,
as in  <script src=LocalFileName.js>
from within a local html file that you are browsing.
This is primarily used by people who build and debug websites, like me.
It is also handy if you have downloaded your own private copy
of a website, and it uses javascript.

3.1.2:
Files (other than text or html) are processed according
to their mime type, which is fancy internet jargon for their file extension.
It's not rocket science - file.mp3 is sent to an mp3 player,
file.wav is sent to a wave player, and so on.
See the docs for more details.

3.1.1:
Version 2 used my own, home-grown javascript engine.
This version, version 3 and beyond, uses an open source js engine,
known as Spider Monkey Javascript, or smjs.
Needless to say, theirs is better than mine.
It's something I should not try to reinvent.
As you might imagine,
many websites will run properly on version 3, but not on version 2.
This is a substantial change to the program,
hence the jump in major version number.

2.2.10:
This is the latest version with my home-grown javascript engine.
If you don't have access to smjs, or you just want to get it up and running
quickly, to see if you like it, you can use 2.2.10.

1.5.17:
This is the latest perl version.
It has no javascript support, nor does it handle edbrowse scripts,
but it is completely portable, and runs on Windows, Mac, etc.
This is the easiest way to take edbrowse out for a spin, to see if you like it.
