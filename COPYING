As a special exception, I hereby grant permission to link the code of this

You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the

you may extend this exception to your version of the program,

This program uses libsmjs.so for javascript, and libcurl.so for http/ftp access.
These are released under the Mozilla public license (mpl).
I didn't change any of the source; I merely link to these libraries.
However, if you wish to release a version of edbrowse with these shared
libraries included,
or a statically linked executable, you will need to specify both gpl and mpl.
