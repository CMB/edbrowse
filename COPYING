This program uses libcurl.so for http/ftp access.
This is released under the curl license, a derivative of the MIT license.
I didn't change any of the source; I merely link to these libraries.
If you wish to release a version of edbrowse with these shared
libraries included,
or a statically linked executable, you will need to specify both GPL and curl.

Some aspects of the DOM, e.g. Blob,
are third party software, released under the MIT public license.
See shared.js for this code.
Also, we employ the quick js engine, which is released under the MIT public license.

In summary: GPL + MIT public license,
+ curl license if edbrowse is packaged with curl.
