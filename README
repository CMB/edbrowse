Disclaimer: this software is provided as-is,
with no guarantee that it will perform as expected.
It might trash your precious files.
It might send bad data across the Internet,
causing you to buy a $37,000 elephant instead of
$37 worth of printer supplies.
It may delete all the rows in your mysql customer table.
Use this program at your own risk.

------------------------------------------------------------

Netscape and Explorer are graphical browsers.
Lynx and Links are screen browsers.
This is a command line browser; the only one of its kind.

The user's guide can be found in doc/usersguide.html (in this package).
Of course this reasoning is a bit circular.
You need to use a browser to read the documentation,
which describes how to use the browser.
Well you can always do this:

cd doc ; lynx -dump usersguide.html >usersguide.txt

This produces the documentation in text form,
which you can read using your favorite editor.
Of course we hope edbrowse will eventually become your
favorite editor, whence you can browse the documentation directly.

The doc directory also includes a sample config file, and a script to help you
set up your own, customized config file.
Run setup.ebrc and answer the questions.
(This assumes you are using bash.)

------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, I'm going to assume you've read the documentation.
No need to repeat all that here.
You're here because you want to compile the program, or modify the source
in some way.  Great!

I haven't developed a configure script, and I should do that some day,
but meantime just type make and hope for the best.

As you may know, edbrowse was originally a perl script.
As such, it was only natural to use perl regular expressions for
my search/substitute functions in the editor.
And once you've experienced the power of perl regexp, you'll never
go back to ed.  So I use the perl compatible regular expression
library, /lib/libpcre.so.0, available on most Linux systems.
If you don't have this file, check your installation disks.
the pcre and pcre-devel packages might be there, just not installed.
If you can't find them there, you can get the pcre source here.

ftp://ftp.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/pcre/

Note that my files include <pcre.h>.
Some distributions put it in /usr/include/pcre/pcre.h,
so you'll have to adjust the source, the -I path, or make a link.
Yeah I know, that's something a configure script should do for you,
but I'm just not there yet.

We assume you have the ssl libraries installed, for secure connections.
You just can't buy anything on the Net without secure connections,
so I make no effort to "work around" these libraries.
You just have to have them, period.
If you don't have /lib/libssl.so.2, you'll need to install the library,
or build the package from source.

http://www.openssl.org/source/

You also need libcurl, which is included in almost every Linux distro.
This is used for ftp, http, and https.
Check for /usr/include/curl/curl.h
Edbrowse requires version 7.17.0 or later.  If you compiled with a version
prior to 7.17.0, the program will inform you that you need to upgrade.

Finally, you need the Spider Monkey javascript engine from Mozilla.org
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/
Edbrowse 3.4.7 or less requires Mozilla js version 1.5.
Edbrowse 3.4.8 requires Mozilla js version 1.8.5.
Edbrowse 3.5.1 requires Mozilla js version 2.4.
If this is not available in your distribution, download into /usr/local,
expand, cd js/src, ./configure, make, and make install.
https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/mozjs-24.2.0.tar.bz2
Lots of warning messages in the build, don't worry about those.
This creats /usr/local/lib/libmozjs-24.so, and with /usr/local/lib
already in my /etc/ld.so.conf, I thought I'd be fine,
but I had to run ldconfig again anyways, not sure why.
Back in your edbrowse/src directory,
you may need to set some flags on the command line
if you had to install Mozilla js as above.
The following works for me.

make JS_CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/mozjs-24 JSLIB=-lmozjs-24 edbrowse

If you want database access, you need unixODBC and unixODBC-devel.
Make edbrowseodbc, rather than edbrowse.

If you're a developer and you want to use the symbolic debugger,
set EBDEBUG=on before you run make.

------------------------------------------------------------

The code in this project is indented via the script Lindent,
which is in the tools directory, and is taken from the Linux kernel source.
In other words, the indenting style is the same as the Linux kernel.
If you modify some source, you may want to run it through
../tools/Lindent before the commit.
An exception is eb.p.
The extern "C" { }, mandated by C++, indents everything for no reason.
So I maintain this file by hand.
It is flush with the left, and it doesn't change very often.

Error conventions.
Unix commands return 0 for ok, and a negative number for a problem.
I return true for success and false for error.
The error message is in a buffer, which you can see by typing h,
in the /bin/ed fashion.
Sometimes the error is displayed no matter what,
like when you are reading or writing files.
error messages are created according to your locale, i.e. in your language,
if a translation is available.
Some error messages in the database world have not yet been internationalized.
Some are beyond my control, as they come from odbc or its native driver.

------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Representations.

A web form asks for your name, and you type in Fred Flintstone.
This piece of data is part of your edbrowse buffer.
In this sense it is merely text.
You can make corrections with the substitute command,
use the undo command to back up, etc.
Yet it is also carried into the html tags in html.c,
so that it can be sent when you push the submit button.
This is a second copy of the data.
As if that weren't bad enough, I now need a third copy for javascript.
When js accesses form.fullname.value, it needs to find,
and in some cases change, the text that you entered.
I believe the first representation, in your editor, must be separate
from the second and third (which I have managed to merge together).
Remember that an input field could be an antire text area,
i.e. the text in another editing session.
When you are in that session, composing your thoughts,
am I really going to take every textual change, every substitute,
every delete, every insert, every undo,
and map those changes over to the html tag that goes with this session,
and the java variable that goes with this session?
I don't think so!
So I'm stuck with something almost as bad.
As part of the browse command, the field data, whether set up by html
or modified by javascript, must be copied into your editor text.
Then you can change it to your heart's content, but when you submit the form,
or run any javascript for any reason, all that text has to be carried
back to the javascript world.
This is accomplished by jSyncup() in html.c.
When javascript is done, any changes it has made to the fields have
to be mapped back to the editor, where you can see them.
This is done by javaSetsTagVar() in html.c.

You should really receive some alerts if fields
have been changed out from under you.
A sighted person would see the screen change, but you can't.
You know that field says Fred Flintstone, that's what you typed
in, but javascript has changed it to Barney Rubble, and you need
to be notified.
Edbrowse does this for you.

Line 357 has been updated.

------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, some of this code looks like it was written, well,
in my spare time; and it was, because I needed this tool desperately.
No careful methodology, just "Gitter Duhn".

Along with some cleanup, and even some modest enhancements,
edbrowse really needs a rewrite.
Today, it takes html text and tags, and builds
javascript objects to go along with those tags; and it builds the screen,
(I'll call it a screen, it's really a text buffer),
in parallel, at the same time.
But what it should do is not build the screen at all on the first pass.
Text would simply be turned into a string
and put in as an attribute in whatever object we are working on at the time,
or the document object if no tag has appeared yet.
All internal.
Then you run the javascript, and it perhaps creates more objects,
creates lists dynamically,
builds entirely new paragraphs, images, links, whatever it does.
Then pass 3, render the screen by traversing the tree of objects
depth first.
That is your text buffer.

Now, if anything changes, through some onclick code perhaps,
you have a new tree of objects,
so Simply rerender the screen.
In our case that builds a new text buffer.
Maybe this is what standard browsers do; I don't know.
But there's something we should do that they don't.
Keep a copy of the old screen and run diff.
If one or two lines have changed,
or if a menu has changed behind the scenes, report that to the user.
It's something a sighted person would notice right away,
but I would be left in the dark.
If there are many changes, just say "entire buffer has changed".
Anyways, this is the kind of rewrite that needs to happen.
Think of this as version 4.1.

In parallel, we are moving from C to C++, as mandated by mozjs 24.
All that code dedicated to growing strings dynamically,
and freeing them without memory leaks, etc, etc, has become a royal pain,
and will be much nicer with string objects.
Also my list macros will become array methods.
Version 4.2.

After this, enhance the DOM with the createElement methods.
This lets javascript create its own tables, paragraphs, lists, images, etc,
and yes, some websites do indeed do this.
Version 4.3.

Then, stop turning html tags into javascript objects by hand;
that is reinventing the wheel.
When you run into <P>, simply call createElement("paragraph"),
or something along those lines.
We have to implement all this in DOM JS eventually, so once this is done,
why not take advantage of it.
Version 4.4.
