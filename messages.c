/*********************************************************************
Now for the international version of caseShift.
This converts anything that might reasonably be a letter, such as » and Ë.
This routine is used by default; even if the language is English.
After all, you might be a native English speaker, using edbrowse
in English, but you are writing a document in French.
This (unfortunately) does not affect \w in regular expressions,
which is still restricted to English letters.
Even more annoying, \b uses English as boundary,
so that \bbar\b will indeed match on the line foo»bar.
There may be a way to set locale in libpcre; I don't know.
Anyways, here are the nonascii letters, upper and lower.
