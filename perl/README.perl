This directory contains the original version of edbrowse, written in Perl.
It is here for historical purposes only.  The Perl version is neither
supported nor maintained.
That said, it is still useful in some circumstances.  It will run on any
machine that has a Perl interpreter.  You can use it on all sorts of systems
that cannot run the C version of edbrowse.
It's also useful if you want to take edbrowse for a quick test-drive.
