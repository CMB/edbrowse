#  You should probably use one server, your ISP's local mail server,
#  to transmit all your outgoing mail.
#  Your ISP trusts you, and nobody else does,
#  and there's no password in the SMTP protocol,
#  so you may find that your far mailbox, in another time zone,
#  will let you get mail (with your password), but not send mail.
#  So send everything through your local mail server.
#  The entry with the leading * is assumed to be the local mail account.
#  If you tell this program to send mail via another account,
#  The mail will "look" like it came from that other account,
#  and replies will go back to that other account,
#  but the local server is still used to send the mail.
#  The sm feature in edbrowse uses your local mail server.

#  Your full name is sent with every outgoing email,
#  so the recipient knows who you are.

#  Here's the first filter rule.
#  Each morning I receive the "word of the day", with definition and etimology,
#  from Merriam Webster.
#  It's really quite interesting, but I often want to read it at my leisure,
#  not while I'm plowing through my mail messages.
#  So I dump it into a file "wod".
#  I use to do this manually, almost a reflex action,
#  but now the filtering rule does it for me.
#  Keep in mind, if I haven't read my mail for three days,
#  there will be three of these.
#  That's ok - they all get appended onto the wod file.
#  I'll read them all, then delete the file.

#  Tell them you're Explorer, and they'll let you in the door.
#  At that point the site may or may not work with edbrowse.
#  Might not, if it uses javascript all over the place.
#  But it's worth a try.  At least you're in.
